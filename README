- Comix README -

NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the development branch towards Comix 4.0. It is not complete yet,
so you are encouraged to use the 3.X version instead.


About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer. It reads
images in ZIP, RAR or tar archives as well as plain image files. It is
written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings. 


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run "python install.py install" as root to install Comix in /usr/local.
To uninstall, simply run "python install.py uninstall".

If you wish to install Comix in another base directory, use the --dir option.

Example:

    # python install.py --dir /usr install

If you have installed with --dir, do not forget to use the same option when
uninstalling.

There is also an option, --no-mime, that can be used to tell install.py that
it should not register new mime types for cbz, cbr and cbt archives, or
install the thumbnail creation script for these files used by some file
managers (such as Nautilus and Thunar).

As an example of how to install Comix from the downloaded tar.gz file, run
as the root user (via su or sudo):

    # tar -xzf comix-x.y.tar.gz
    # cd comix-x.y
    # python install.py install

If you don't want to install Comix in some system directory, you can just
execute the file src/comix.py in the unpacked Comix directory to run the
program. You could also create a symlink somewhere in your PATH pointing to
this file.


Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comix needs Python 2.4, PyGTK 2.10.0 and PIL (Python Imaging Library) 1.1.5 or
newer to function. 

You also need the "unrar" or "rar" program installed if you wish to read
RAR (.cbr) archives.
