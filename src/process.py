"""process.py - Process spawning module.

The subprocess and popen2 modules in Python are broken (see issue 1336).
The problem (i.e. complete crash) they can cause happen fairly often (once
is too often) in Comix when calling "rar" or "unrar" to extract specific
files from archives. We roll our own very simple process spawning module
here instead (and surely introduce a whole new array of exciting bugs!)
